Our fun aside for this week is Cre-Lox recombination! And no, this has nothing to do with smoked salmon.

Suppose you'd like to target a cell population based on a protein it expresses (think Mrgpr2). Maybe you want to make those cells susceptible to a diptheria toxin so you can wipe them out of your mouse, or maybe you just want to fluorescently label them. The key of the Cre-Lox system used here is having the same promoter for your target gene
