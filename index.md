<h3>Welcome to 15 minute papers!</h3>
Our goal is to expose people to a broad variety of research fields with digestible glimpses into actual publications. 
<br><br> In each of our episodes, we will take you through the background of a specific laboratory, and, within a quick 15 minutes, guide you through a publication with one of the actual authors!
