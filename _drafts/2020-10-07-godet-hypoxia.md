  - keyterms:
      - term: "Mast Cell"
        defn: "Innate immune cells that are typically talked about in terms of allergies. They respond to foreign substances from the environment and signal other immune cells to enact an immune response (and in this case, also a nervous system response). "
      
      - term: "Mas-related G protein coupled receptors (Mrgprs)"
        defn: "G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a class of receptors on cell surfaces that, when stimulated with their ligand, activate a signalling pathway inside the cell. Mrgprs are a family of GPCRs that are found on peripheral sensory neurons and mast cells. In this paper, the Mrgb2 receptor is responsible for activating mast cells to release cytokines."
      
      - term: "Peripheral sensory neuron"
        defn: "All the neurons in our body that aren’t in the spinal cord or brain that sense outside stimuli rather than doing what the brain tells them to. Those would be peripheral motor neurons."

      - term: "Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia" 
        defn: "Atypical increased sensitivity to pain (mechanical → poking stimulus; thermal → heat stimulus). This is caused by neurogenic inflammation."

      - term: "Neurogenic inflammation" 
        defn: "The release of cytokines and recruitment of immune cells initiated by neurons."
      
      - term: "Substance P (SP)" 
        defn: "A peptide that binds to receptors on immune cells to regulate their inflammatory response. In the context of this paper, it’s the peptide released by neurons that binds the Mrgb2 receptor on mast cells to start the inflammation."
      - term: "Cytokines/chemokines" 
        defn: "Chemical messengers that signal for other cells to be activated and/or to migrate towards the damaged tissue. Some key examples from this paper were CCL2 and CCL3."

      - term: "NK-1R" 
        defn: "We didn’t talk about it much, but this was the most studied receptor that SP binds to; it was incorrectly thought to be the receptor that initiates the pain response. A lot of the reviewers of the paper were interested in the fact that SP wasn’t actually binding to this receptor during the pain response."
